\title{Gene enrichment using Enrichr}
\usage{
enrichr(
  genes,
  databases = NULL,
  background = NULL,
  include_overlap = FALSE,
  sleepTime = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{genes}{(Required). Character vector of Entrez gene symbols as input. A data.frame
of gene symbols in first column is also acceptable, optionally a score denoting the
degree of membership between 0 and 1 in the second column.}

\item{databases}{(Required). Character vector of databases to search.
See https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/ for available databases.}

\item{background}{(Optional). Character vector of Entrez gene symbols to be used as
background. A data.frame of gene symbols in first column is also acceptable. 
Default is \code{"NULL"}. Enrichment analysis with background genes is only available 
on the main site (Enrichr). Also, it is using a different API service (Speedrichr), 
hence it is a little slower to complete and return the results.}

\item{include_overlap}{(Optional). Download database in GMT format to include 'Overlap'
in the resulting data.frame when analysing with a background. Default is \code{"FALSE"}.}

\item{sleepTime}{(Optional) Time to wait (in seconds) between sending requests to the server to prevent the same results being returned as the previous request. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
Returns a list of data.frame of enrichment terms, p-values, ...
}
\description{
Gene enrichment using Enrichr
}
\details{
Gene enrichment using Enrichr, also, you can now try adding a background.
}
\examples{
data(input) # Load example input genes
data(background) # Load example background genes
dbs <- c("GO_Molecular_Function_2023", "GO_Cellular_Component_2023",
         "GO_Biological_Process_2023")
if (getOption("enrichR.live")) {
  enriched1 <- enrichr(input, dbs)
  print(head(enriched1[[1]]))

  # Include background
  enriched2 <- enrichr(input, dbs, background = background)
  print(head(enriched2[[1]]))

  # Include background and add 'Overlap' info
  enriched3 <- enrichr(input, dbs, background = background, include_overlap = TRUE)
  print(head(enriched3[[1]]))
}
